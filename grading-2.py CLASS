# Calculating Grades (ok, let me think about this one)

# Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades,
# return an average test score, a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

# Average	Grade
# 90+	A
# 80-89	B
# 70-79	C
# 60-69	D
# 0-59	F

# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student iis failing.

exam_one = int(input("Input exam grade one: "))

exam_two = input("Input exam grade two: ")  # Deleted the extra quotation mark

exam_three = str(input("Input exam grade three: "))  # Changed exam 3 to the word three

grades = [exam_one, exam_two, exam_three]
sum = 0
for grade in grades:  # added extra s in grades 
  sum = sum + grade

avg = sum / len(grades)  # grades was not spelled correct

if avg >= 90:
    letter_grade = "A"
elif avg <= 80 and avg < 90:  # added a semicolon at the end if the phrase
    letter_grade = "B"
elif avg <= 69 and avg < 80:
    letter_grade = "C"  # added the same quotation mark
elif avg >= 69 and avg >= 65:
    letter_grade = "D"
elif avg >= 65 and avg >= 0:  # added a whole new phrase
    letter_grade = "F"

for grade in grades:
    print("Exam: " + str(grade))

    print("Average: " + str(avg))

    print("Grade: " + letter_grade)

if letter-grade is "F":
    print("Student is failing.")  # added quotation marks and closed them with ()
else:
    print("Student is passing.")  # added quotation marks and closed them
